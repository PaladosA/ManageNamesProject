This repository houses a java program constructed to be a simple name logging and displaying code.

Introduction:
    This project was developed as a small logger for keeping track of names. 
The program can log first names and last names, as well as the total number of members added. When the program is used it will display to the user the names in a simple list as well as the member total. The purpose of the program was to display information in a simple list and total members on a given run for quick reference purposes.

Methodology:
    The code is written in java and is spanding between two class files. These files
are Names.java and ManageNames.java. Names.java was the definition class for Name objects to be added into the ManageNames code. ManageNames is where the user can implement new additions to the list as well as displaying said list for optimized reading purposes. The user can create new name objects and display code using the base templates provided. The total number of names will automatically increase as the code runs depending on name objects present.

The code and application of said code has been used and tested by members
of writing intensive classes and approved by every user as working as intended.

Results:
    The application was used to keep track of names in writing and group projects
Using the list display to remind fellow members of important names when wrting papers. The list was used practically and as intended, and the addition of the name counter was used to keep track of a criteria of important figures needed for the mentioned research paper. The application tracked what was needed and worked as intended.

Conclusion:
    The program was successful in aiding students keep track of important names for
writing projects. The application was used practically to a desired effect and made writing output more efficiant. I believe this tool could be very useful for students who need quick references for previously mentioned names in any situation. I believe it can serve as a qick valuable tool in writings as well as research papers.
